# Comparing Collaborative Filtering-based Recommender and Hybrid Recommender Systems
A recommendation model is an algorithm that aims to provide the most relevant and relatable information to a user depending on the behaviour of the user. There exist variety of methods for doing this tasks. Choosing the right algorithm is based on the application and effectiveness of the method. This project aims to implement collaborative filtering-based recommender, content-based recommender and hybrid recommender for movie recommendation. The algorithms are also evaluated using different evaluation matrices and the results are compared.
